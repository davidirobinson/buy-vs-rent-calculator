## Key Assumptions

- The script assumes you will live in the house you buy, hence the mortgage repayment replaces rent.
- The comparison between buying and renting scenarios is based on minimizing the two cash flows required to service each living situation.
- Surplus funds under the cheaper living scenario are invested.
- The house is not sold during the comparison period.
